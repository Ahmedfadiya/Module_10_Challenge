# Module_7_Challenge
# Financial Databases with SQL

I am creating a prototype for submitting the crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors.
I am combining financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills.

I created a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods and then ploted the results so that you can visually see the performance.

The CSV file that’s provided for this Challenge contains the price change data of cryptocurrencies in different periods.
The task are:

•Import the Data (provided in the starter code)
•Prepare the Data (provided in the starter code)
•Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data
•Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
•Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
•Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
•Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
•Visualize and Compare the Results
